# aictf

Installation:

sudo docker build --tag python-docker . 

sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 python-docker

Hopefully you should now be able to access it on http://127.0.0.1:5000

A redacted version of the source code is provided that you can look at, Everything inside the AICTF folder should be considered hidden from the users.

CNN has a starting point for making adversarial images. Everything else you need for the CTF you should be able to find in the redacted source code. Plus a way to automate some web requests :)

I wrote 13 of the challenges, the 14th is a ctf challenge from PicoCTF2018 that I expand upon, so I've added it here so people can adapt the solution code for it to the model theft challenges. 

The link to the memory file in Theft3 is too big for github, so you will have to get code exec yourself or do your own memory dump and work off it. :)

Happy Hacking.
