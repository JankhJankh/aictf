# aictf

Installation:

sudo docker build --tag python-docker . 

sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 python-docker

Hopefully you should now be able to access it on http://127.0.0.1:5000

A redacted version of the source code is provided that you can look at, Everything inside the AICTF folder should be considered hidden from the users.

CNN has a starting point for making adversarial images. Everything else you need for the CTF you should be able to find in the redacted source code. Plus a way to automate some web requests :)
